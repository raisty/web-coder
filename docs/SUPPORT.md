## Where to get help

If you think you've found a bug in The Coder Theme, please [check the existing issues](https://github.com/raisty/web-coder/issues), and if no one has reported the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/raisty/web-coder/issues/new).

If you have a general question about the theme, how to implement it, or how to customize it for your site  you have two options:

1. [Contact Coder Support](mailto:537310+raisty@users.noreply.github.com), or

2. Ask your question of the Jekyll community on [talk.jekyllrb.com](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/)
